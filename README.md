The purpose of this application is to provide an application where locations of Hotels are recommended based on the prefferable temperatures that an prospective traveler may be interested in. By providing your preferred climate temperates, you can find a hotel within a 30 mile radius within these preffered weather conditions. 

### Vacation Itinerary

For myself, I created an itinerary for 4 cities in Italy, starting at Fiumicino. From our start point, we go on to 3 other cities ; Siderno, Gela and Cinisi respectively.
